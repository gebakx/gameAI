# Artificial Intelligence

#### .blue[Definitions]:

- an agent does tasks normally attached to humans (or animals)

- an agent has AI when it exhibits "smart" features:
  - learning, reasoning, behavior, reaction


#### .blue[Examples]:

- play chess

- reading license plates

- weather forecasting

# Game AI properties

*Building a game experience should be our main objective.*

.blue[The Complexity Fallacy]: <br>
- Select always the simplest way to give the illusion of complexity

- .blue[Occam's Razor]: the simplest explanation is most likely the right one

.blue[Perception window]:
- Interaction with agents lasts a very short time.

- Try to avoid commonsense behavioral changes <br>(see 2on video at references).
